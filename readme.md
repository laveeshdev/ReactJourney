## Lets Learn React

# the intital entry point for us in react :

pakage.json file is the file which contain all the essential to start the react project
particulary the " script " contains all the methods like , dev , test , build , start

## while developement we use "dev"

## and to finally deploy we use the build script and then only use build folder instead of our entire react app

### VITE

# this is just a pakage installer , multiple libraries , dependancies and folders in react . we just use it to intialise our app react and its enviroment

" npm create vite@latest"
But this doesnt contain the node modules , just react stuff , thus we further install node in it
"npm install "
